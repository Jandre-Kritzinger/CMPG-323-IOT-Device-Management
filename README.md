# CMPG-323-IOT-Device-Management

In this project I will primarily target the completion of Tier 1, and if I manage to do that and gather a decent understanding of the work I shall attempt to implement tier 2.

I have accidentally committed the appsettings.json file, and I could not for the life of me find a way to remove it from the branch.
